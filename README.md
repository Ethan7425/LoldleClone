## 📜 About

This game was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is a clone of the popular **Loldle** game but with a unique twist. Currently, it features a splash screen where players can attempt to guess the right character.

## 🎮 Difficulty Levels

The game offers three different difficulty levels, each affecting the size of the crop and making the guessing experience more challenging!

### 1. **Easy**
- **Crop Size**: Small
- **Description**: This level gives you a larger view of the character, making it easier to guess.
- **Best for**: Beginners or those looking for a casual game.

### 2. **Medium**
- **Crop Size**: Moderate
- **Description**: A balanced difficulty, where you get a decent portion of the character to guess but it's still challenging.
- **Best for**: Players looking for a good challenge without being overwhelming.

### 3. **Hard**
- **Crop Size**: Large
- **Description**: This level provides a very small crop, making it hard to identify the character. Prepare for a tough challenge!
- **Best for**: Advanced players or those who want a real test of their memory and skills.
